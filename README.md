# Zen Water Art

This is the first project I worked on at DevMountain Coding Bootcamp.

I decided to create a 'paint application' simulating the popular product Buddha Boards: http://buddhaboard.com/ 

My goal was to create a server-less, single page application that featured the HTML5 canvas element

## Getting Started

Instructions: 
- Choose a brush by clicking on one of the circles located on the brush image
- Paint to your hearts desire, and watch your work gently fade away.

This application is hosted on my Digital Ocean droplet @  http://www.zenwaterart.site

### Design

I chose to use minimal, simplistic design. And use css and a brush image to simulate an actual Buddha Board.

### MVP and Summary

Minimum viable product:
- 2 Angular views: entrance and canvas
- 6 different brushes
- Canvas must fade out creating a simulation of water evaporating

Overall this project was very fun. I really liked manipulating and understanding canvas. Also creating the code for each brush signature was a great challenge and very interesting. My next canvas based project will probably be a Zen Sand Garden to compliment the skills I learned here.
